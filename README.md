# RandomPassGenerator
An application for generating random passwords

## NodeJS Server
First step is to run your node server, which is hooked up to Heroku

Go to the main directory of the project and run
```
yarn install
```
then run
```
yarn start
```

You should see nodemon running and listening on port `5000`


## React App
Now switch folders and go to `/client`
Inside `/client` run the following
```
yarn install
```
then
```
yarn start
```
Now the front-end app should be loaded on port `3000` and a browser Tab should open automatically, if not, go to `http://localhost:3000`
